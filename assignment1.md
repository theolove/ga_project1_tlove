***Algorithm:*** Anomaly Detection

***What it solves:*** How to identify outliers in a generally homogenous data set.


***What it does:*** The algorithm identifies outliers for a single classificatipn of data. This is useful where the data set contains a lot of information under a single classification, but the user would want to know what data might not conform to this classification without having access to additional data outside of this classification. 

***Potential applications:*** A few ways this can be used include

- Identifying fraudelent activity, such as rebate applications that are falsified
- Identifying incorrect utility meter readings
- Identifying outliers within a data set so the data can be "cleaned" for further analysis
