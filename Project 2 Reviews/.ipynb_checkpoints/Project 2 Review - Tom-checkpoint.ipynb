    "#Project Review of Tom Barnes NFL Data Analysis\n",
    "*Author: Theo Love*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "* Good job walking through the data clean up and additional variable generation including the transformations.\n",
    "* Good exploration of the decision trees in both models and excellent optimization.\n",
    "* Always good to have sanity checks that show an understanding of the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments/Questions\n",
    "* It's a bit tough to see what each of the columns mean\n",
    "* Glad to see comparisons against dummies and that you get a decent\n",
    "* The graphviz trees did not show up in my notebook viewer\n",
    "* I woudn't worry about NaNs either, considering they are 1/10th of 1% of your observations\n",
    "* For your second model is MSE the best option to optimize on?\n",
    "* It makes sense that it would be easier to guess who wins the game, than it is to get the score from a drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions\n",
    "* Changing variables names to something more readable would be helpful\n",
    "* It would be interesting to see how the bookmakers ratings did vs just Elo or win/loss ratios\n",
    "* Perhaps bringing in more team or player specific data and not just game data might help your score prediction model."
