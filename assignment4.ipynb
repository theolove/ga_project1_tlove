      "* Looking at the source for the alcohol data, it appears that the methodology of collecting consumption data relies on sales and tax records. How would this change analysis? I know we discussed how New Hampshire is somewhere that people from other states go to buy alcohol. I think the same is true for DC, since it has lots of commuters who live in Virginia or Maryland.\n",

It sounded from the presentation that a lot of work went in to it. The web-scraping dead-end sounded really interesting (let's see some code!). The source you gave for the current data says its not available. Where did you end up getting it, and how did you have to massage it? Were there any missing data you had to deal with?\n",
