I work as a consultant and recent partner @ [Green Energy Economics Group](http://www.greenenergyeconomics.com/).

###Data Experience

I have been working with data my entire career, starting as a reporting analyst at a Alliance Bernstein, continuing as a product manager for a copyright database application, and to my current role working with in the energy efficiency sector.

For the past few years our firm has been collecting data on spending and savings for different energy efficiency programs around North America. We use this data to provide predictive models and benchmarking tools for other programs and stakeholders. You can find some of this work [here](http://www.greenenergyeconomics.com/2012/08/an-empirical-model-for-predicting-electric-energy-efficiency-acquisition-costs-in-north-america-analysis-and-application/) and [here](http://www.greenenergyeconomics.com/2012/04/electric-energy-efficiency-resource-acquisition-options-for-austin-energy/).

###Why GA Data Science?

I have always been interested in the intersection of computer science and applied mathematics, especially as it has related to industry. Until recently, I did not have a definition for this field.

I work in a very small organization, in an industry more driven by lawyers and engineers than silicon valley entreprenuers, so I have been mainly growing my knowledge of modern data analysis techniques through self exploration. This can only get you so far. Also, the recent passing of our company's co-founder has created a need for us to re-focus what our core value proposition is. I decided I needed a way to make my background in math and comp sci relevant to the current state of the art.

I found out about GA in a [New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price) and decided to check it out. I used to rent office space in Chinatown @ [Greenspaces](http://greenspaces.com/new-york-city/), and missed having a broader community of entreprenuers in NYC. Reading about the data science class and the general GA mission, I felt that this would be something right down my alley.

The data science aspect, in particular, was a way to christalize my past experiences to make it more easily translated to potential clients and colleagues. Interestingly, I have a very good friend who helped Wes (the pandas creator) get his startup off the ground post-AQR capital, and had been hearing about how great python and pandas were. I attended the info session, and signed up, and now the rest is history.

###Cool Data Site
I stumbled across [Setosa](http://setosa.io) the other day and was very impressed with the fantastic explanations of important topics that are relevant to data science, as well as the very pretty data visulations they have. In particular I liked their exporation of [eigen values and vectors](http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/).
